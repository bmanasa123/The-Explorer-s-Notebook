### 👋 Challenges
In this development, my main challenge was to understand and apply the MaterializeCSS, as by that time, I had only experience with the Bootstrap framework.

***

### 🌟 Key learnings & wins
I was able to work independently on this project and improve my Python, Django, and Mongoose proficiency. I had fun using MaterializeCSS to apply styling while developing this full stack application.

Despite the fact that this was a class assignment, it was a success to design and use every function we were now learning in class.
